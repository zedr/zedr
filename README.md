## Hi there 👋

I'm Rigel and I've been programming computers since I was a child. My first computer was a Commodore Vic 20 back in the Eighties, on which I learned to write simple arcade (PETSCII based!) and text adventure games.

Today I work as an system architect, engineering manager, and software contributor. I also contribute to Free and Open Source projects, such as Django (

My favourite programming languages are Python, C, and JavaScript, but I enjoy learning new ones (lately - Go).

I'm a big fan of Linux and its GNU ecosystem. I run Linux everywhere I can and [promote its use](https://linuxdaymilano.org/schedule/?year=2025).
